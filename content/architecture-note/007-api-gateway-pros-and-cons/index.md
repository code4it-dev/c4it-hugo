Especially when talking about _microservices_, many articles and videos focus on an architectural element that, in their opinion, is absolutely necessary for building such kinds of applications: _API Gateways_.

Yes, they are actually useful, but they are not the solution to every architectural problem.

In this article, we will learn what API Gateways are, their pros and cons, why you should distinguish them from Load Balancers, and more.

## What is an API Gateway?

Imagine that your application is made of several web services and APIs. Each of them will be deployed on a separate host, therefore having a different URL.

While it can be helpful for internal development - you have a clear separation of operations available in your system - it can become cumbersome for the developers who have to integrate all those endpoints in their application.

That's where API Gateways come into play: they **add a sort of _fa√ßade_ in front of your set of APIs** to uniform the access to your system.

Say that you've built a Hotel booking system that is made of 3 services:

- _BookingAPI_, deployed at *https://bookings.mycompany.org/api*
- _SearchAPI_, deployed at *https://mycompany.org/search/api*
- _DiscountAPI_, deployed at *https://discounts.mycompany.org/v1/api* (notice the _v1_)

![Booking service without API Gateway](./booking-service-without-api-gateway.png)

By adding an API Gateway, you can hide these APIs behind a single host, like *https://api.mycompany.org/*, mapping the route path to the original services' URLs.

As with everything in the world, there are advantages and disadvantages. Let's learn! üî•

## Advantages of an API Gateway

API Gateways have lots of advantages. It's not a coincidence that they are being used in many architectures.

Let's see some of the best characteristics of an API Gateway.

### Internal API security

Since your internal APIs are hidden behind an API Gateway, you make them _less_ discoverable by intruders that might want to access your systems and data.

Let's go back to the Hotel Booking system in our example. External users will only see the _api.mycompany.com_ host without knowing the structure of the internal API services. This **reduces the attack surface**.

You can also **centralize Access Control Policies** by adding them to the API Gateway and have them applied to all the APIs behind the Gateway.

Finally, you can **monitor all the incoming requests** and analyze the traffic to spot unusual behaviour in a single place.

### Reduced complexity

Some concerns are common to all the APIs within the same system, such as **rate limiting**, **throttling**, and **access control**.

With API Gateways, you can **centralize the settings** for such common concerns in a single point. For example, once you have defined some rate limiting policies on your Gateway, you can have the same settings automatically applied to every internal API endpoint (well, not "physically" applied to the internal APIs, but since the Gateway block some incoming requests, they will not reach the internal systems as well).

API Gateways also help with **service documentation**: since you have all the internal services listed in the API Gateway, just by looking at its configurations, you can see the list of the deployed APIs and their hostname.

### Flexibility

Since API Gateways act as a fa√ßade in front of other services, you can integrate services that work with **different protocols or formats**.

For example, you can have one service that exposes GraphQL APIs, another one that works with GRPC, and have them all exposed as REST APIs using the API Gateway as a wrapper/converter to and from such formats.

Hiding the actual API endpoints behind a Gateway also allows you to **implement [API Composition](https://www.code4it.dev/blog/overview-api-gateways/#api-composition)**, which is a technique that will enable you to aggregate the results from different internal API calls and return the caller only the final result (as opposed as making the client call each single service and compose the result afterwards).

![API Composition simplifies the data aggregation](./api-composition.png)

### Enhanced performance

Depending on the vendor, you can have different tools to improve the overall performance.

For example, you can **cache responses** to get quicker response times, or you can apply uniformed **data compressions**.

Some vendors allow you to have multiple instances of the same service available behind the API Gateway, acting as a sort of Load Balancer.

Another powerful technique you can implement is [SSL Termination](https://www.code4it.dev/blog/overview-api-gateways/#ssl-termination). In a simple architecture, if you have to communicate securely with 3 systems to aggregate the result, you have to validate the SSL connection three times. With **SSL Termination**, you can move these operations on the API Gateway component and avoid doing that in all the other services, making the application more performant.

## Disadvangages

### Single point of failure

Since we placed an API Gateway in front of all the other API applications, all the external communication passes through the API Gateway.

This means that **if the API Gateway is unavailable, the whole system becomes unavailable as well**, even though the single APIs are still up and running.

So, when using an API Gateway:

- **beware of the settings**: an error in the configurations can have consequences on the whole system;
- ensure that the Gateway is capable of handling the incoming load of requests: if the API Gateway cannot cope with the number of incoming requests, it may become unavailable and make the whole system offline.
- ensure that you have some **protection against DDoS attacks** (see the previous point).

### Increased latency

An API Gateway is an **additional hop** in the API processing: when a client wants to call an API application, all requests must first pass through the API Gateway, which, in turn, will call the internal API.

This processing, this routing, adds some network latency. Maybe it's not noticeable, but it depends on the Gateway you choose, the underlying infrastructure, and the processing done by the Gateway.

![An API Gateway adds some latency in the request flow](./api-gateway-add-latency.png)

### Vendor Lock-in

Once you have deployed and configured an API Gateway, moving to another vendor might be difficult.

You risk vendor lock-in, with all the consequences: if the price goes up or if they remove some functionalities that you need, you will have to come up with a solution to migrate that specific part of your infrastructure to another vendor.

It might not be so easy - some straightforward ways to mitigate the risk are to **make your systems platform agnostic** and to **create e2e tests** that validate the routing and the functionalities.

## API Gateway VS Load Balancer

Some people I know, and the authors of some articles I read, use API Gateway and Load Balancer as synonyms.

Let me get it straight: **they are not the same!**

Yes, they both are components that work with incoming requests. But they serve two totally different purposes.

While Load Balancers "just" spread incoming requests across multiple instances of the same service, API Gateways act as a fa√ßade in front of different types of services.

They are two totally different components of an architecture.

Some vendors provide both functionalities, while others don't. So, keep the two meanings distinct, and try to use the correct wording.

## API Gateway vendors comparison

## Wrapping up

Beware those who say that API Gateways are ¬´the best thing to add to a microservice architecture¬ª! As we learned, there are some downsides, too.

Always make sure that the products and the components you choose fit your necessities and that you learn when something is **not** for you.
