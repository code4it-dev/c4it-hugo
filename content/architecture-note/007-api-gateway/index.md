## What is API gateway

## Advantages of an API Gateway

Some of the pros and cons of using an API gateway are:

Pros:

It can improve the security of the APIs by hiding the endpoints from the public and implementing access control policies123.

It can reduce the complexity of the microservices by handling common concerns such as rate limiting, versioning, and user onboarding12.

It can enhance the performance of the APIs by caching responses, compressing data, and balancing the load124.

It can enable the flexibility of the APIs by supporting different protocols, formats, and devices124.

## Disadvangages

It can introduce a single point of failure in the system if not designed properly2.
It can increase the latency of the API calls due to the additional processing and network hops23.
It can add more overhead and complexity to the development and deployment process23.
It can create vendor lock-in if using a proprietary or managed service35.
