Ciao, I'm **Davide Bellone**, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my blog! 🎉

I'm a seasoned software developer with over a decade of experience under my belt. Currently, I'm rocking the role of **Principal Backend Developer** in beautiful Italy.

My journey with Microsoft platforms and frameworks began in 2014. I kicked things off as a SharePoint developer, then transitioned to ASP.NET MVC 5, .NET API, Angular 6, and finally embraced my true calling as a full-fledged backend developer. 💻

Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of tools and frameworks, including **Azure**, **SQL**,  **MongoDB**, **Docker**, and, of course, **.NET** and **C#**. 🚀

I'm passionate about learning new things, and I firmly believe that sharing knowledge is the best way to learn. That's why I embarked on my adventure as a **blogger**, **content creator** and **conference speaker**. 🎤

If you'd like to stay connected, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bellonedavide/), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/bellonedavide.bsky.social), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BelloneDavide).  Let's keep the conversation going!

Oh, and did I mention? I'm also a proud [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5005077?fullName=Davide%20Bellone) 🏆 !
