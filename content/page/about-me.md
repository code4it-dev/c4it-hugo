Ciao, I'm **Davide Bellone**!

I'm a software developer with more than 9 years of professional experience.

I'm currently employed as a **senior backend developer** in Turin, **Italy**.

I've been working with Microsoft platforms and frameworks since 2014: I started as a SharePoint developer, then I moved to ASP.NET MVC 5, .NET API, Angular 6, and finally I became a full backend developer.

I've worked with many tools and frameworks, such as **Azure**, **MongoDB**, **Docker**, and, of course **.NET and C#**.

I love learning new things, and I think that the best way to learn is to share: that's why I started my journey as a **content creator and conference speaker**.

If you want to keep in touch, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BelloneDavide) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bellonedavide/) where I publish interesting (I hopeüòÅ) content about C# and .NET!

Ah, and I'm also a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5005077?fullName=Davide%20Bellone) üèÜ !
