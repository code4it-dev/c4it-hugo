It's time to review this book!

* **Book title**: C# 11 and .NET 7 - Modern Cross-Platform Development Fundamentals
* **Author(s)**: Mark J. Price ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjamesprice/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markjprice) )
* **Published year**: 2022
* **Publisher**: Packt
* **Links**: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/11-NET-Cross-Platform-Development-Fundamentals/dp/1803237805), [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/product/c-11-and-net-7-modern-cross-platform-development-fundamentals-seventh-edition/9781803237800)

What can we say?

This is a *HUGE* book - ~750 pages - that guides readers from the very basics of C# and dotnet to advanced topics and approaches.

This book starts from the very beginning, so it explains the history of C# and .NET, then moves to C# syntax, and then explores OOP topics. 

So, if you have already some experience with C#, you might be tempted to skip those chapters. **Don't skip them**! Yes, they're oriented to newbies, but you'll find some gems that you might find interesting or that you might have ignored before.

Then, things get really interesting: some of my favourite topics were:

* how to build and distribute packages
* how to publish Console Apps
* Entity Framework (which I used in the past, before .NET Core, so it was a nice way to see how things evolved)
* Blazor

## What I liked

* well explained
* you have access to the code example to follow along (also, the author explains how to install and configure stuff necessary to follow along, such as SQL Lite when talking about Entity Framework)
* it also teaches you how to use Visual Studio

## What I did not like

* in the printed version some images are not that readable
* experienced developers might find some chapters boring (well, they're not the target audience of the book, so it makes sense ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è )
