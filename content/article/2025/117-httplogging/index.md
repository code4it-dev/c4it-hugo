Whenever we publish a service, it is important to add proper logging to the application. Logging helps us understand how the system works and behaves, and it's a fundamental component that helps us troubleshoot problems that occur during the actual usage of the application.

We have talked several times about logging. But we mostly focused on the logs written manually.

In this article, we are going to learn how to log incoming HTTP requests to help us understand how our APIs are being used from the outside.

## Scaffolding the empty project

To showcase this type of logging, I created an ASP.NET API. It's a very simple application, with CRUD operations on an in-memory collection. 


```cs
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class BooksController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly List<Book> booksCatalogue = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new Book
    {
        Id = index,
        Title = $"Book with ID {index}"
    }).ToList();

    private readonly ILogger<BooksController> _logger;

    public BooksController(ILogger<BooksController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
}
```

These CRUD operations are exposed via HTTP APIs, following the usual verb-based convention. 

For example:

```cs
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public ActionResult<Book> GetBook([FromRoute] int id)
{

    _logger.LogInformation("Looking if in my collection with {TotalBooksCount} books there is one with ID {SearchedId}"
        , booksCatalogue.Count, id);

    Book? book = booksCatalogue.SingleOrDefault(x => x.Id == id);
    
    return book switch
    {
        null => NotFound(),
        _ => Ok(book)
    };
}
```

As you can see, I have added some custom logs: before searching for the element with the specified ID, I also write a log message such as "Looking if in my collection with 5 books there is one with ID 2". 

Where can I find the message? Well, on Seq!

Seq is a popular log sink (well, as you may know, my favourite one!), that is easy to install and to integrate with .NET. I've thoroughly explained how to use Seq in conjunction with .NET in [this article](https://www.code4it.dev/blog/logging-with-ilogger-and-seq/).

In short the most important change in your application is to add Seq as the log sink, like this:

```cs
builder.Services.AddLogging(lb => {
    lb.AddSeq();
});
```

Now, whenever I call the GET endpoint, I can see the related log messages appear in Seq:

![Custom log messages](custom-log-messages-on-seq.png)

But sometimes it's not enough. I want more details, and I want them to be applied everywhere!

## How to add Http Logging to an ASP.NET application

HTTP Logging is a way of logging most of the details of the incoming HTTP operations, tracking both the requests and the resposes.

With HTTP logging you don't need to write custom logs to access the details of incoming requests: you just need to add a middleware, configure it as you want, and have all the required logs available in all your endpoints.

Adding it is pretty straightforward: you first need to add the `HttpLogging` middleware to the list of services:

```cs
builder.Services.AddHttpLogging(_ => { });
```

so that you can use it once the WebApplication instance is built:

```cs
app.UseHttpLogging();
```

There's still a problem, though: all the logs generated via HttpLogging are ignored, as logs coming from their namespace (named `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging.HttpLoggingMiddleware`) are at *Information* log level, thus ignored by default. 

You either have to update the `appsetting.json` file to tell the logging system to preocess such logs:

```json
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging.HttpLoggingMiddleware": "Information"
  }
}
```

or, alternatively, you need to do the same when setting up the logging system in the Program class:

```diff
builder.Services.AddLogging(lb => {
    lb.AddSeq();
+   lb.AddFilter("Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging.HttpLoggingMiddleware", LogLevel.Information);
});
```

We then have all our pieces into place: let's execute the application!

First, you can spin up the API; you should be able to see the Swagger page:

![Swagger page for our application's API](api-swagger-page.png)


From here, I can call the GET endpoint  

![Http response of the API call, as seen on Swagger](http-get-response.png)

I am now able to see all the logs in Seq:

![Logs list in Seq](logs-list-in-seq.png)

As you can see, I have a log entry for the request, and one for the response. Also, of course, I have the custom message I added manually in the C# method.

If we open the log related to the HTTP request, we can see all these values:

![Details of the HTTP Request](http-request-log-details.png)

Among these details, we can see properties such as:

- the host name (*localhost:7164*)
- the method (*GET*)
- the path (*/books/4*)

and much more. 

Of course, we can see some interesting data in the Response log:

![Details of the HTTP Response](http-response-log-details.png)

Here, among some other properties such as the Host name, we can see the Status Code and the Trace Id (which, as you may notice, is the same as the one in te Request).
