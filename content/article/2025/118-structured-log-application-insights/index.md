Logging is crucial for any application. However, generating logs is not enough: you also have to store them somewhere in order to access them.

Application Insights is one of the tools that allow you to store your logs in a cloud enviroment, prividing you with a UI and a query editor that gives you the possibility to drill down into the details of your logs.

In this article, we are going to learn how to integrate Azure Application Insights with an ASP.NET Core application. We will also focus on how Application Insights treats log properties such as Log Levels and exceptions.

For the sake of this article, I'm working on an API project with HTTP Controllers with only one endpoint. The same approach can be used for other types of applications.

## How to retrieve the Azure Application Insights connection string

Azure Application Insights can be accessed via browser by using the Azure Portal. 

Once you have an instance ready, all you need to do is to get the value of the connection string to that resource.

You can retrieve it in two ways: by looking at the Connection String property in the resource overview panel:

![Azure Application Insights overview panel](azure-application-insights-overview.png)

Or, alternatively, by navigating to the Configure > Properties page, and locating the Connection String field.

Either ways are fine.

## How to add Azure Application Insights to an ASP.NET Core application

Now that you have the connection string, you can place it in the configuration file - or, however, in a place that can be accessible from you application.

To configure ASP.NET Core to use Application Insights, you first have to install the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights` NuGet package.

Now you can add a new configuration to the Program class (or wherever you configure your services and the ASP.NET core pipeline):


```cs
builder.Logging.AddApplicationInsights(
configureTelemetryConfiguration: (config) =>
    config.ConnectionString = "InstrumentationKey=your-connection-string",
    configureApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions: (options) => { }
);
```

The `configureApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions` allows you to configure some additional properties: `TrackExceptionsAsExceptionTelemetry`, `IncludeScopes` and `FlushOnDispose`. These properties are by default set to `true`, so most probably you don't want to change the default behavior (except one, that we'll modify later on).

And that's it! You have Application Insights ready to be used.

## How log levels are tracked on Application Insights

I have this API endpoint that does nothing fancy: it just returns a random number.

```cs
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class MyDummyController(ILogger<DummyController> logger) : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<DummyController> _logger = logger;

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Get()
    {
        int number = Random.Shared.Next();
        return Ok(number);
    }
}
```

We can use it to run experiments on how logs are treated using Application Insights.

First, let's add some simple log messages in the `Get` endpoint:

```cs
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> Get()
{
    int number = Random.Shared.Next();

    _logger.LogDebug("A debug log");
    _logger.LogTrace("A trace log");
    _logger.LogInformation("An information log");
    _logger.LogWarning("A warning log");
    _logger.LogError("An error log");
    _logger.LogCritical("A critical log");

    return Ok(number);
}
```

These are just plain messages. Let's search for them in Application Insights! 

You first have to run the application - duh! - and what for a 2 or 3 minutes to have the logs ready on Azure. So, remember not to close the application immediatly: you have to give it a few seconds to send the log messages to Application Insights.

Then, you can access the logs panel and run access the logs stored in the `traces` table.

![Log levels displayed on Azure Application Insights](log-levels-on-application-insights.png)

As you can see, the messages appear in the query result.

There are three important things to notice: 

- in .NET, the log level is called "Log Level", while on Application Insights it's called "severityLevel"; 
- the log levels lower than Information are ignored by defaul (in fact, you cannot see them in the query result);
- the Log Levels are exposed as numbers in the severityLevel column: the higher the value, the higher the level of the log.
 
So, if you want to update the query to show only the log messages that are at least Warnings, you can do something like this:

```kql
traces
| where severityLevel >= 2
| order  by timestamp desc 
| project timestamp, message, severityLevel
```

## How to log exceptions on Application Insights

In the previous example, we logged errors like this:

```cs
_logger.LogError("An error log");
```

Fortunatly, `ILogger` exposes an overload that accepts in input an exception and logs all the details.

Lets's try it by throwing an exception (I chose `AbandonedMutexException` because it's totally nonsense in this simple context, so it's easy to spot).

```cs
private void SomethingWithException(int number)
{
    try
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("In the Try block");

        throw new AbandonedMutexException("An exception message");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("In the Catch block");
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Unable to complete the operation");
    }
    finally
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("In the Finally block");
    }
}
```

So, when calling it, we expect to se 4 log entries, one of which contains the details of the `AbandonedMutexException` exception.


![The Exception message in Application Insights](application-insights-no-exception.png)

Hey, where is the exception message??

It turns out that `ILogger`, when creating log entries like `_logger.LogError("An error log");`, generates objects of type `TraceTelemetry`.

But the overload that accepts as a first parameter an exception (`_logger.LogError(ex, "Unable to complete the operation");`), internally is handled as an `ExceptionTelemetry` object.

Since - internally - it's a different type of Telemetry object, it gets ignored by default.

To enable logging exceptions, you have to update the way you add ApplicationInsights to your application, by setting the `TrackExceptionsAsExceptionTelemetry` property to `false`:

```cs
builder.Logging.AddApplicationInsights(
configureTelemetryConfiguration: (config) =>
    config.ConnectionString = connectionString,
    configureApplicationInsightsLoggerOptions: (options) => options.TrackExceptionsAsExceptionTelemetry = false);
```

This way, ExceptionsTelemetry objects are treated as TraceTelemetry logs, making them available in Application Insights logs:

![The Exception log appears in Application Insights](exception-log-in-application-insights.png)

Then, to access the details of the exception (like the message and the stack trace) you can look into the `customDimensions` element of the log entry:

![Details of the Exception log](log-exception-details.png)

Even though this change is necessary to have exception logging work, it is [barely described in the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/ilogger#what-application-insights-telemetry-type-is-produced-from-ilogger-logs-where-can-i-see-ilogger-logs-in-application-insights?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5005077).
