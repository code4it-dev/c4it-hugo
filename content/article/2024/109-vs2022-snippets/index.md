One of the best tricks to boost productivity is knowing your tools.

As you may know, in VisualStudio 2022 you can use predefined snippets. For example, when you type *ctor* and hit Tab twice, VS automatically creates an empty constructor for the current class.

In this article, we are going to learn how to create custom snippets: in particular, we will create a snippet that automatically creates a C# Unit Test method with some placeholders and predefined Arrange-Act-Assert blocks.

## Install Snippet Designer in Visual Studio 2022

**Snippets are defined in XML-like files with `.snippet` extension**. But we all know that working with XMLs can be cumbersome, expecially if you don't have a clear idea of the expected structure.

Therefore, even if not strictly necessary, I suggest you to install a VS2022 extension called *Snippet Designer 2022*.

![Snippet Designer 2022 in VS2022](snippet-designer-extension.png)

This extension, developed by Matthew Manela, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mmanela/SnippetDesigner), where you can have a look at the source code.

This extension gives you a UI you can use to customize the snippet instead of manually editing the XML nodes. It allows you to customize the snippet, the related metadata, and even the placeholders.

## Our very first custom snippet

As we saw, snippets are defined in a simple XML.

In order to have your snippets immediately available in VS, I suggest you to create those files in a specific VS2022 folder, under the path `\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets\`.

So, create an empty file, change its extension to `.snippet`, and save to that location.

![Save snippet file under the My Code Snippets folder in VS2022](./my-code-snippets-folder.png)

Now, you can open Visual Studio (it's not necessary to open a project, but I'd recommend you to do so). Then, head to File > Open, and open the file you just saved under the My Code Snippets directory.

Thanks to Snippet Designer, you will then see a nice UI instead of the plain XML content. 

Have a look at how I filled in the several parts to create a snippet that generates a variable named `x`, assigns to it a value, and then call `x++`;

![Nota anche la sidebar](./first-snippet-ui.png)

Have a look at the main parts:

- the body, which contains the snippet to be generated;
- the top layer, where we specified:
  - the Snippet name: Int100; it's the display name of the shortcut
  - the code language: C#;
  - the shortcut: int100; it's the string you'll type in that allows you to genereate the expected snippet;
- the bottom table, which contains the placeholders used in the snippet; more on this later;
- the properties tab, on the sidebar: here is where you specify some additional metadata, such as:
  - Author, Description, and Help Url of the snippet, in case you want to export it;
  - the kind of snippet: possible values are MethodBody, MethodDecl and TypeDecl.However, this value is only supported in Visual Basic.

Now, hit save and be ready to import it!

Just for completeness, here's the resulting XML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
    <Header>
      <SnippetTypes>
        <SnippetType>Expansion</SnippetType>
      </SnippetTypes>
      <Title>Int100</Title>
      <Author>
      </Author>
      <Description>
      </Description>
      <HelpUrl>
      </HelpUrl>
      <Shortcut>int100</Shortcut>
    </Header>
    <Snippet>
      <Code Kind="method decl" Language="csharp" Delimiter="$"><![CDATA[int x = 100;
x++;]]></Code>
    </Snippet>
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

## Import the snippet in VS2022

It's time to import the snippet. Open the Tools menu item and click on Code Snippets Manager.

![Code Snippets Manager menu item, under Tools](./code-snippets-manager-menu-item.png)

From here, you can import a snippet by clicking the Import... button. In our case, given that we've already saved our snippet in the correct folder, we'll find it under the My Code Snippets folder.

![Code Snippets Manager tool](./code-snippets-manager.png)

Now it's ready! Open a C# class, and start typing `int100`. You'll see our snippet in the outocomplete list. 

![Int100 snippet is now visible in Visual Studio](snippet-int100.png)

By hitting Tab twice, then, you'll see the content of the snippet being generated

## How to use placeholders when defining snippets in Visual Studio

Wouldn't it be nice to have the possibility to define customizable parts of your snippets?

Let's see a real example: I want to create a snippet to create unit tests with these characteristics:

- it already contains the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) sections;
- the method name should follow the pattern "SOMETHING should DO STUFF when CONDITION". In particular, it will be MethodName_Should_DoSomething_When_ConditionIsMet.

You can define placeholders using the `$` symbol. You will then see the placeholders in the table at the bottom of the UI. In this example, the placeholders are `$TestMethod$`, `$DoSomething$`, and `$Condition$`. For each of these placeholders I also added a description, to better explain the purpose of each placeholder.

![Alt text](./testsync-snippet.png)

The XML looks like this:


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
  <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
    <Header>
      <SnippetTypes>
        <SnippetType>Expansion</SnippetType>
      </SnippetTypes>
      <Title>Test Sync</Title>
      <Author>Davide Bellone</Author>
      <Description>Scaffold the AAA structure for synchronous NUnit tests</Description>
      <HelpUrl>
      </HelpUrl>
      <Shortcut>testsync</Shortcut>
    </Header>
    <Snippet>
      <Declarations>
        <Literal Editable="true">
          <ID>TestMethod</ID>
          <ToolTip>Name of the method to be tested</ToolTip>
          <Default>TestMethod</Default>
          <Function>
          </Function>
        </Literal>
        <Literal Editable="true">
          <ID>DoSomething</ID>
          <ToolTip>Expected behavior or result</ToolTip>
          <Default>DoSomething</Default>
          <Function>
          </Function>
        </Literal>
        <Literal Editable="true">
          <ID>Condition</ID>
          <ToolTip>Initial conditions</ToolTip>
          <Default>Condition</Default>
          <Function>
          </Function>
        </Literal>
      </Declarations>
      <Code Language="csharp" Delimiter="$" Kind="method decl"><![CDATA[[Test]
public void $TestMethod$_Should_$DoSomething$_When_$Condition$()
{
    // Arrange

    // Act

    // Assert 

}]]></Code>
    </Snippet>
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

Now, import it as we already did before.

Then, head to your code, start typing `testsync`, and you'll see the snippet coming to life. The placeholders we defined are higlighted. You can the fill in these placeholders, hit tab, and move to the next one.

## Bonus: how to view all the snippets defined in VS

If you want to learn more about your IDE and the available snippets, you can have a look at the Snippet Explorer table.

You can find it under *View* > *Tools* > *Snippet Explorer*.

![Apri View>Tools>Snippet explorer](./snippet-explorer-menu-item.png)

Here you can see all the snippets, their shortcuts, and the content of each snippet. You can also see the placehoders, highlighted in green.

![List of snippets available in Snippet Explorer](./snippet-explorer-details.png)

It's a good place to learn more about Visual Studio.

## Further readings

As always, you can read more on Microsoft Docs. It's a valuable resource, even thought I find it quite difficult to follow.

## Wrapping up

There are some tips that may improve both the code quality and the developer productivity.

If you want to enforce some structures or rules, I suggest to add such snippets in your repository and, when somebody joins your team, teach them how to import those snippets.
