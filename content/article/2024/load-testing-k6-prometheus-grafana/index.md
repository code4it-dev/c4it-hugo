Understanding how your system reacts to incoming network traffic is crucial to understand if it's stable, if it can meet the expected [SLO](https://www.code4it.dev/architecture-notes/sli-vs-slo-vs-sla/), and if the underlying infrastructure and architecture are fine.

How can we simulate lots of incoming requests? How can we *harvest* the results of our API calls?

In this article, we will learn how to use K6, Prometheus, and Grafana to run load tests locally in Windows11. We will use Prometheus and Grafana to display a diagram showing the results of our load tests.

## Load testing

Load testing simulates real-world usage conditions to ensure that the software can handle high traffic without compromising performance or user experience. 

The importance of load testing lies in its ability to **identify bottlenecks and weak points** in the system that could lead to slow response times, errors, or crashes when under stress. 

By conducting load testing, developers can make necessary optimizations and improvements, ensuring the software is robust, reliable, and scalable. It's an essential step in delivering a quality product that meets user expectations and maintains business continuity during peak usage times.

Without load testing, there's a significant risk of software failure, which can result in user dissatisfaction, loss of revenue, and damage to the company's reputation. 

Ideally, you should plan to have automatic load tests in place in your Continuous Delivery pipelines, or, at least, ensure that you run Load tests in your production environment now and then. You then want to compare the test results with the previous ones, to ensure that you haven't introduced bottlenecks in the last releases.

## Install K6

The first tool we are going to use is [K6](https://k6.io/).
With K6 you can run the Load Tests by defining the endpoint to call, the number of requests per minute, and some other configurations.

It's a free tool, and you can install it using Winget:

```bash
winget install k6 --source winget
```
